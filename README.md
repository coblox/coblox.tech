# coblox.tech
Website of the CoBloX research lab.

This is a fairly static site that can be maintained by a text editor (such as Atom: https://atom.io/).

The intended entry point is index.html; should render fine as long as the directory structure is intact. 

Recommend adding the project directory to prepros (https://prepros.io/), which would allow you to test the site without running into Single Origin Policy problems. 

Important:
Committing to origin master on this repository WILL automatically publish to coblox.tech on Netlify (i.e make the changes live).
